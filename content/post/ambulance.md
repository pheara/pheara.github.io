For this game we were asked to use a random generator. One of
the combinations the wonderful
[grow-a-game cards](http://valuesatplay.org/grow-a-game-overview)
spit out, was “Cooperation-Disease-GTA-Creativity”, which inspired Marie and me
to a cooperative racing game in the health-sector &ndash; “Ambulance”. One player
drives the car, in a simplified version this is just the three lanes
seen in the sketch, the other person tries to keep the patient alive until
they reach the hospital by playing a game of dexterity. Every time
the driver makes sudden movements, the medics job becomes
harder―life-threatening errors ensue. Thus it’s necessary that
the players, who are sitting next to each other and playig on
their phones, communicate well―especially the driver before
they make maneuvers.
