This is the first of a set of sketches for the VU “Game Design” at the Vienna University of Technology. The idea for the game is rather simple―instead of playing the big characters, you’re playing the small side-element. Imagine mellow, emotionally music playing while you use swipes or presses to generate small gust of wind, which blow along a feather and carry it along through a maze of difficulties to finally reach Forrest.

An alternative mechanic also playing with the theme “wind” was an autumn-themed game. All the trees are losing their leaves, which need to be blown along to clear the boardwalk. Again using swipes sources can be placed that blow into the swiped direction. Constructing a path from multiple of these, a stream of leaves is moved out of the way, e.g. to garbage bins.
