Due to good contacts to the ruling parties and their willingness to increase surveillance, you can sell your products (CCTV, IMSI-catchers,...) to them and make good profit. The only hindrance to you and your elected buddies is a reluctant populace (expressed by the bar in the top right) that might sanction your network on the next voting day. Make sure not to push your products to strongly or they might revolt (red marker). Good luck and good profit!");
