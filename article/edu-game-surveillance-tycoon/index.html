    <p>You can play “Surveillance Tycoon” here:</p>
<p><a href="/games/surveillance_tycoon/index.html">Play Me!</a>.</p>
<p>Here's also a short <em>gameplay video</em> if you don't want to try it yourself (for whatever reason) or think you have missed something. It also shortly discusses the design:</p>

<h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
<p>For this excercise Alex Sinnl and I worked together. You can find his take on this design <a href="https://gamefuldesign15.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/aufgabe-7-designprozess/">here</a>. We exchanged a few initial ideas via email and then had one meeting / design session at a white-board (for a total of about 4h of work). Most of this challenges effort went into development (~12h) as the requirement was for it to be digital. Documentation took about 5 hours.</p>
<p>The topic was <em>informatics and society</em>. We explored and shortly iterated over a few ideas in regard to that. As you can see in the sketches below.</p>
<h3 id="solo-sketching">Solo-Sketching</h3>
<p>In the game directly below the player would have to dodge the view- and circles-cones caused by cctv-cams and flyover drones in a bullet-hell like manner. The theme here is more coating than really integrated into the mechanics though.</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/sketches/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On most of the next sketch I've played with a few story-driven approaches / sub-themes. The graphic in the center of the right side would be a rhythm game thematizing the factory-work.</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/sketches/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Small scribbles about mechanics, sub-themes or meta-approaches:</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/sketches/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this page the rhythm-game concept started to expand a bit:</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/sketches/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the left side I started exploring a few concepts around the mechanics of trolling, flaming and flamewars. The right side uses trolls as a simple skinning for &ldquo;the bad guys&rdquo; in a plattformer, a plain propaganda game without deeper message or discussion of the issues around trolling:</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/sketches/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="design-session">Design-Session</h3>
<p>This whiteboard-sketch contains some of the concepts already discussed above, drawn here to have an <strong>overview</strong>. New thoughts / concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could implement the story-driven approaches as visual-novel. This would lessen development effort, however introduce the effort to create a truly compelling and critical narrative.</li>
<li>Time-travel based games to highlight long-term cause-effect pairs/chains.</li>
<li>We could do some sort of social-networking game where people try to maximize their reach (the graph on the top-right)</li>
<li>A game where you use your activists to work on embodied social-problems (a bit like <em>Pigmin</em> or <em>Overlord</em> maybe?)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/whiteboard/all-the-games.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below you can see the part of the overview that had been blanked out above. It starts playing with the role-reversal game of <em>CCTV-Tycoon</em>. It already contains the idea of using social-capital/resentment as build-resource (though also as a radar-chart) and to nudge the player towards a strategy of small increments to avoid a critical mass of resentment (as can be seen in real policy-making).</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/whiteboard/initial.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This little doodle elaborates the resentment-bar a bit:</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/whiteboard/social-capital-meter.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Playing with generic names for the sample setting and small details:</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/whiteboard/income-and-setting.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This sketch shows a quick take at a possible game-UI. Note that it has multiple surveillance system types and a internet-map as second theater. Both of these features didn't make it into the first prototype.</p>
<p><img src="/media/educative_games/whiteboard/gui.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below you can find a listing of possible options for surveillance systems that the player could sell:</p>
