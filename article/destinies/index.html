<p>One of the two game ideas for this weeks should be
an “impossible” game by deconstructing a genre. The
challenge is to reduce such a genre to it’s core
mechanics and then remove one of
those, essentially making it “impossible” to adhere
to the genre-as-is. Examples would be “RTS without units”,
“Beat Game without Music” or “RPG without playing a character”.</p>
<p>“Destinies” results from the last of these primary generators. instead
of playing a character, the two players play disembodied forces
of luck and misfortune, triumph and defeat. A rather dim-witted
hero stumbles through a dungeon in an attempt to get the loot
and rescue the world. The player of luck plays cards to see
them succeed, whereas misfortune tries to make their life harder.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanic for moving the hero would be, to have
them follow the right-hand rule―while prohibiting circles
in the dungeon. If they meet a challenge, they role
3dFudge (dice with ‘-1’, ‘0’, ‘+1’), sum them and add
their relevant stat and compare it with the difficulty
of the challenge to see if they've made it. If they fail,
they take the challenges consequences.</p>
<h2 id="stats-and-challenges">Stats and challenges:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Combat” vs monsters</li>
<li>“Reflexes” vs traps</li>
<li>“Intelligence” vs puzzles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cards">Cards</h2>
<p>Most cards should have trade-offs, e.g. harder monster
yield more treasure to the hero that makes them better
in tackling later challenges.</p>
<p>For card-draw, per default draw-one-play-one
should be tried out. Either both players draw
from the same deck and there’s a mechanic for discarding
cards, or both get their separate decks.</p>
<p>Card-ideas for Luck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level-up: Improves one of the heroes stats</li>
<li>Item: places an item in a room. The hero picks it up,
if they wander into that room. The item-card specifies when
it will be used and what benefit it brings, e.g. heal, add a
one-time bonus vs a certain challenge type, teleport the hero,&hellip;</li>
<li>Shift rooms (think “mad labyrinth”)</li>
<li>Place rooms</li>
<li>Hidden Door: a sufficiently aware/intelligent hero can find it
and take short-cut, possibly skipping some dangers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Card-ideas for Misfortune:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place traps, e.g. poison that decreases a stat, a fireball that deals damage</li>
<li>Cursed Item: works similiar to the Luck-players ‘Item’-card
but with negative effects</li>
<li>Shift rooms (think “mad labyrinth”)</li>
<li>Place rooms</li>
<li>Place (wandering) monsters</li>
<li>Place puzzles, e.g. they might block off a dead-end
(read: non-critical path) that contains treasure</li>
<li>Place alcohol: the trusting, short-sighted hero drinks it
and some stat decreases</li>
<li>Cave-In: Blocks one of several paths to the goal. This card
shouldn’t be used with a hero following the right-hand-rule.</li>
<li>Overlooked Door: this door is ignored for the next application
of the right hand rule. Remove the condition after that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>Most people thought it was too complicated, respectively hard to understand.</p>
<p>It might be interesting if the hero’s position is unknown
(“Mr. X”-style). It probably would be better if both used
the same deck and fortune needs to play misfortune cards
in a way that the hero can beat them easily and reap the
treasures. Also a labeled die that in most cases causes
a movement towards the goal might be more interesting.</p>
<p>Lev, however added, that the game has potential if these
challenges are tackled and clarified.</p>
